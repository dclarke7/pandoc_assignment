# 1. Section Header

Here are the opening lines to Nabokov's *Pale Fire*:

I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By the false azure in the windowpane;
I was the smudge of ashen fluff - and I
Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky.
And from the inside, too, I'd duplicate
Myself, my lamp, an apple on a plate:
Uncurtaining the night, I'd let dark glass
Hang all the furniture above the grass,
And how delightful when a fall of snow
Covered my glimpse of lawn and reached up so
As to make chair and bed exactly stand
Upon that snow, out in that crystal land!

Here is some **boldface**, some *italics*, and some ``typewriter`` font.
I can even \underline{underline some text}.
Here is how you make a footnote.[^1]
You can store them at the bottom of the paragraph.[^2]
Though, to be sure, you can make the footnote key any text, like Katz v. United States.[^Katz67]

[^1]: Just in case you forgot.
[^2]: *Ibid*.
[^Katz67]: 389 U.S. 347, 348 (1967) [*Katz*]

## A. Subsection

Here is a numbered list with a sub-list:

1. The first
    a. sub-lists in pandoc require four spaces
    b. every time
        i. sub sub lists require eight spaces
        ii. every time
2. The second
3. The third


### i. Subsubsection

Here is a bulleted list in LaTeX:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first bullet
  \item The second bullet
\end{itemize}

It's a lot easier in ``pandoc``: 

- the first bullet
- the second bullet
